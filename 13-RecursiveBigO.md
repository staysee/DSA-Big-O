<!-- Take your solutions from the recursive exercises that you completed 
in the previous checkpoint and identify the time complexities (big O) of each of them. -->

1. counting Sheep: 0(n) linear - grows with increase size of string
2. Power Calculator:
3. Reverse String: 0(n) linear - grows with increase size of string
4. nth Triangular Number: 0(n) linear - grows with increase size of string
5. String Splitter: 0(n) linear - grows with increase size of string
6. Fibonacci - 0(2^n) exponential - each function calls itself twice
7. Factorial - 0(n) linear - grows with increase size of string
8. Maze - 
9. AllMaze - 
10. Anagrams - 0(2^n) exponential - the funcation calls itself as many times as our string length
11. Org Chart - 
12. Binary - 0(log(n)) logarithmic - the problem size is cut in half each round because we divided the number by 2
